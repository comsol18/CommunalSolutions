# Communal Solutions

Communal Solutions is a solution to help the modern android user stay safer than ever.

## Getting Started

To begin development enter the following into your terminal to download the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/ogparry1/CommunalSolutions.git
```
The application is using Google's Firebase Database, so ask the administrator for access to the google console.  You will be required to add your digital fingerprint to the Firebase as can be seen in this [forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39144629/how-to-add-sha-1-to-android-application).  You will also need to add your digital signature to the Google API Key on the Google Cloud Platform.

All Android development should be done under the Android_master branch and Apple development likewise under the iOS_master branch.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Google account.
Android Studios is recommended.

### Installing

To install the application onto your phone, you can either run it through Android Studios using android debugging, or you can join the alpha test as Communal Solutions has been published to the Google Play store.
